# Smaug
Your little dragon companion on Discord! ^.=.^

## What's this?
This is a mini-project purely for my enjoyment. This bot is written in Node.js.

## Invite link
[Add Smaug to your server!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=557528854147629056&scope=bot&permissions=325712)

## Getting Started
The default prefix is `,,`  
Use `,,help` to see the list of commands.  
Use `,,prefix [new-prefix]` if you would like to change the prefix (server-specific).

## To-do (and possible future developments)
- [ ] ,,rs roles clear command
- [ ] Restructure the Pokeverse Lock system: Raider, Rare and Mega Boss
