# Smaug
Your little dragon companion on Discord! ^.=.^

## What's this?
This is a mini-project purely for my enjoyment. This bot is written in Node.js.

## Getting Started
The default prefix is `,,`  
Use `,,help` to see the list of commands.  
Use `,,prefix [new-prefix]` if you would like to change the prefix (server-specific).

## To-do (and possible future developments)
- [X] Add custom prefix feature
- [ ] Make a currency system
- [ ] And of course, add games to make use of the currency system
- [ ] Make zs's graph theory battle royale
- [ ] Try to learn how to use a database
